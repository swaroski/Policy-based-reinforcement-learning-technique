# Policy-based-reinforcement-learning-technique
Here we shall implement the policy based reinforcement learning technique using Tensorflow. We will implement an agent that will learn to keep the bar in balance. Policy gradients are highly effective in high dimensional action spaces, or when using continuous actions.
